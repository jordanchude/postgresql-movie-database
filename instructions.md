# Codecademy Postgres Off Platform Project: Making a Database of Movies
```
Welcome! This is likely your first off-platform project in PostgreSQL. Because of this, the goals of this
project are relatively straightforward: let's get comfortable using our PostgreSQL client (most likely Postbird)
to interact with our PostgreSQL server! In this project, we'll focus on creating tables, inserting data into
those tables, and running some basic queries to see that data. Let's get started!
```
## Part 1 — Creating Tables

Let's begin by creating a table to store some of our favorite movies. Open up your Postgres client, connect to a
database, and create a table named films that has a TEXT column to store the name of a film, and an
INTEGER column to store a release_year for each film.

If you're using Postbird for your client, you can connect to a database by using the dropdown menu in the top
left corner. You can then create a new table in two different ways:

```
. You can go to the Query tab and write your CREATE TABLE statement as if you were writing SQL on
Codecademy. Pressing "Run Query" will run your CREATE TABLE statement.
. You can use the plus symbol in the bottom left corner of Postbird to create a new table. This will open a
pop-up window that asks for the table name. After giving the table a name, you'll be directed to the
"Structure" tab where you can use the interface to create more columns. Notice that when you create a
new table using this method, some columns will be created by default (for us, a column named id was
created by default). Many clients will have a way to use a GUI (graphical user interface) to do tasks that
you could do yourself by writing lines of SQL. When using a GUI it's good practice to think about what
lines of SQL the GUI is running behind the scenes.
```
## Part 2 — Saving Our Favorite Movies

Letʼs go ahead and insert our favorite movies into our films table! Weʼll need to know the name and release
year to create new entries.

Since you likely donʼt know all release dates off the top of your head, check out IMDb! Itʼs a great place to
search for and discover information about film industry trends and specific movies. Fun fact: IMDb is also using
Postgres behind the scenes!


Some of our favorites at Codecademy include The Matrix (1999), Monsterʼs Inc. (2001), and Call Me By Your
Name (2017).

Write some INSERT statements to add some of your favorite movies to your table!

If you're working in Postbird, you can write your INSERT statements in the Query tab. Once again, clicking "Run
Query" will run those statements. If you want to take a look at the values in your table without writing SELECT
statements, you can take a look at the Content tab after running your INSERT statements.

Be careful not to add a movie multiple times to your table! If you do, you can write DELETE queries in the Query
tab to remove rows from the table. Alternatively, you can use the GUI! You can do this by going to the Content
tab, right-clicking on rows in your table, and selecting "Delete Row".

## Part 3 — Browsing movies

We can use the Content tab to look at our table, but let's get some practice writing SELECT statements. Note
that you can add a WHERE clause to filter your results a bit. For example, adding WHERE release_year =
1999 to the end of your SELECT statement will find all of the movies released in 1999.

Can you find all of the movies you entered to your table that were released the year you were born?

Take a look at how the results of a SELECT statement is displayed in the bottom half of the Postbird Query tab.

Finally, if you want to experiment with Postbird's GUI, try using the Content tab to do that same filter. You
should see a search bar that lets you filter your table based on certain columns. Can you use the GUI to find all
movies in your table released _after_ the year you were born? Again, think about the SQL statements that the GUI
is running behind the scenes.

## Part 4 — Adding Supplementary Information

While the release year for movies is one helpful fact to store, having more information about a movie might help
us better make a selection for movie night.

Some additional data we may want to store is:

```
Runtime (in minutes)
Category (e.g. Action, Comedy, Drama, etc.)
Rating
Box Office Earnings — note that for this column, we used the BIGINT data type because we wanted to
store numbers in the billions!
```
There are many more!

Pick a few new attributes and add new columns to the films table. To do so, weʼll need to make use of ALTER
TABLE statements in the Query tab.

When you add a column, take a look at the Content tab. What values are entered in the existing rows for the
new column?

Once again, you could use Postbird's GUI to take care of this for you! In the "Structure" tab, you can add new
columns. When you use this GUI, notice that you might get an error if you keep "Allow null" unchecked. Again,


think about what SQL is being written behind the scenes depending on whether that box is checked or not.

## Part 5 — Backfilling Data

After we added those new columns, youʼll notice that the values for those columns are NULL for all rows that
were already in the table. Populating missing data retroactively from when the table and initial data was
originally inserted is often called “backfilling.”

Letʼs spend some time adding this additional information to the rows already in our films table. To do so, you
can use the Query tab to write UPDATE statements. Those statements will also use SET and WHERE clauses to
set values of the new columns.

You can also use Postbird's GUI to fill in these missing values. If you go to the Content tab, you can double click
on values to edit those values directly! Notice how the GUI will prevent you from adding data that doesn't meet
the column's data type. For example, the GUI will prevent you from adding letters to an INTEGER column.

## Part 6 — Adding Constraints

For our last task, letʼs add some constraints to our films table to ensure itʼs protected against entering
improperly formatted data.

First, letʼs remind ourselves that data types are a form of constraint. We've seen this already when we tried to
edit values in the table that didn't match the data types.

There are many other types of constraints beyond data types! Right now, it's possible for us to add two movies
with the same name. Let's add a UNIQUE constraint to the name column so you can't add duplicate names
(note that we realize this probably isn't a _great_ constraint... There surely are many movies with the same name.
A better unique constraint might be some id number. But for now, let's stick with name.)

We could have made the constraint when we first made the table, but now that the table is already created,
we'll have to use an ALTER TABLE statement. Here's an example of adding a unique constraint to an already
existing table — in this example, we're adding a constraint onto the release_year column (which isn't a very
good idea to do!):

```
ALTER TABLE films
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_release UNIQUE (release_year);
```
Once you've added the constraint, take the time to experiment with it. Here are a few things that would be good
to try:

```
Look at the Structure tab to verify the existence of the constraint.
Try violating the constraint. Try inserting a new movie with a duplicate name. What happens?
Try updating a row's name so it is a duplicate with an existing row's name. What happens? You could try
this either through writing SQL or through the GUI's Content tab.
Try adding another constraint that is already violated by the data in the table. For example, what happens
if you try to add a UNIQUE constraint to the release_year column, but there are already multiple
movies with the release_year of 1999?
```

## Reflection

Nice work! By working on this project, you practiced writing SQL statements to create tables, insert data into
those tables, edit that data, and add a few constraints. However, more importantly, you became more
experienced with your PostgreSQL client. As our PostgreSQL projects become more complicated, it is
important to be familiar with the tools that you're using. We encourage you to continue experimenting with the
features of whatever PostgreSQL client you are using!
